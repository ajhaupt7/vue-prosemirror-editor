# Vue Prose

A minimal [Prosemirror](https://prosemirror.net/) Wrapper for Vue.js


### Installation

```
npm install vue-prose
```

The `vue-prose` will install prosemirror's dependencies.

You must load the [`style/gapcursor.css`](https://github.com/ProseMirror/prosemirror-gapcursor) styles or define your own styling for the cursor.

### Basic Usage

The most basic usage with an empty editor:

```
// template
<Editor />

// script
import Editor from "vue-prose"

export default {
  components: {
    Editor
  }
}
```

#### Editor

The editor is a component that accepts these props:

* `doc`, an Object, the prosemirror document to be edited. (*Or you can set the `fromContent` prop to true and the document will be parsed from the element with the `#content` id.*)

* `schema`, an Object, the schema to be passed to the editor state.

* `editorProps`, an Object, any props to be passed to editor view.

* `plugins`, an Array, any editor plugins.

* `keyCommands`, a Function, that passes the editor schema so you can register any additional editor key commands.

* `inputs`, an Array, any custom editor input rules.

* `nodeViews`, an Object, any custom editor node views.

* `interceptTransaction`, a function, can be passed to prevent an editor transaction.

* 'editable', a boolean that represents whether editing is allowed.

* `autofocus`, a boolean. Defaults to true.

* `willCreate`, an event that fires when the editor instance is about to be created. Takes no arguments.

* `didCreate`, an event that fires once the editor instance has been created. Will be called with the editor instance and may be used to configure it further.

* `wasUpdated`, an event that will fire whenever the underlying document changes. It is called with the editor state and schema.
